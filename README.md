## Introduction

Working repository for detecting anomalies during sleep.

Motivation is that there is a possibility to detect sleep apnea and other sleep related irregularities from snoring, and other signal processing.

First step currently is to create a classification model that can detect snoring during sleep accurately.

Database for audio signals can be found [here](https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=778740145531650048#p2).

## Requirements

Python 3.6+ is required.

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- Probably python, pytorch or tensorflow runtime, matlab, some other libraries. -->

## Usage


## Contributing

<!-- Need some sort of CI/CD maybe if other people are going to work on it -->
